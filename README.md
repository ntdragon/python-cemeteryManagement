# python-cemeteryManagement - 11/06/2018
A python database program to manage a cemetery

## Introduction
I have recently become the manager of my church's cemetery whose records span a number of years
and are all paper based with some of the earliest records a bit hard to decipher.  In order to
know which plots are sold and used, sold and unused, contain architectural features or trees and
those that are unsold and available I am currently populating spreadsheets to replicate the
master ledger and map.

The plan is to finish the spreadsheets so I can continue operations fairly smoothly and then
build the program.  I have two programs in slow build since I am just getting started with
python and github and this will help me learn python, github and collaborative projects.

The initial program design, development and testing and use by me will be on my Xubuntu computer.
After the first version is ready for use, I will look to see what is needed for use on other OSes
like Macintosh (I have one) and maybe Windows (will need to find someone to help since I don't have
one but my parish administration does in part).

## Desired Design features
Finer design detail will be in the Design directory but the larger topics are presented here.

 - Databased with information on each plot
 - Database with pricing so that price reports can be generated
 - The ability to generate various maps of the cemetery
 - The ability to be seen on computer and cell phones, most work is done on computer but when at the cemetery it is helpful to be able to call up information by myself or the cemetery worker
 - Contain process/procedure/policy information for easy reference
 - Maybe linked with a website (based on reception of the idea from the parish administration)

## Target phases
 - Phase 1:
 -  While getting the spreadsheets populated with all the available information begin database design
 -  Validate spreadsheet information up to the most current information
 -  Sketch out various gui interface specifications along with hard copy requirements
 - Phase 2:
 -  Database coding and testing of input from spreadsheets
 -  Report testing
 - Phase 3:
 -  computer gui coding and testing
 -  initial testing on gui, reports and imported information
 - Phase 4:
 -  getting it so it can be accessed by cell phone for myself and my worker
 -  improve user interfaces based on feedback from various users and potential users
 -  When all is said and ready declare first version ready for use on linux machines
 - Future Phases
 -  seeing if anything is needed for other operating systems to use the program
 -  setting up a website access and pages if permitted and desired
 -  seeing if other ideas and concepts develop as the program and my management progresses

## Current Status
11/06/2018 - Initial set up of git hub project and iniital population of directories
